## Purpose

Provide a repeatable, auditable procedure to diagnose and resolve systemd service failures in the Contoso Systems Administration Lab.

## Scope

This runbook applies to managed Windows Server, Linux, Microsoft 365, Microsoft Entra, Hyper-V, backup, monitoring, and identity services in the lab environment. It is designed for incident response and routine operational support. It does not authorize bypassing security controls or making unapproved production changes.

## Symptoms

- A unit is failed or inactive
- The application does not start after reboot
- A service repeatedly restarts


## Likely causes

- Invalid unit configuration
- Missing dependency, file, or environment variable
- Permission, port, or resource problem


## Prerequisites and safety checks

- Approved support ticket with affected user, system, timestamps, and business impact
- Administrative access appropriate to the platform; use a separate privileged account
- A current backup or rollback path before changing production configuration
- Change approval for service restarts, policy changes, access changes, or reboots


## Diagnostic and resolution procedure

### Step 1: Collect the current state

Run:

```text
sudo systemctl status nginx
```

Record the command output, timestamp, server or user context, and any error code. Do not make a broader change until the result supports it.
### Step 2: Test the most likely dependency

Run:

```text
sudo journalctl -u nginx -b
```

Record the command output, timestamp, server or user context, and any error code. Do not make a broader change until the result supports it.
### Step 3: Inspect logs and configuration

Run:

```text
sudo systemctl cat nginx
```

Record the command output, timestamp, server or user context, and any error code. Do not make a broader change until the result supports it.
### Step 4: Apply the least-disruptive correction

Run:

```text
sudo systemd-analyze verify /etc/systemd/system/nginx.service
```

Record the command output, timestamp, server or user context, and any error code. Do not make a broader change until the result supports it.
### Step 5: Recheck platform health

Run:

```text
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

Record the command output, timestamp, server or user context, and any error code. Do not make a broader change until the result supports it.

## Decision points

1. **The issue cannot be reproduced:** confirm the incident time, device, user, network, and error message; then review historical logs.
2. **The first dependency test fails:** resolve connectivity, name resolution, authentication, storage, or service availability before changing the application.
3. **A change affects multiple users or systems:** stop and use formal change control.
4. **Evidence indicates compromise or unauthorized access:** preserve logs and escalate immediately to Security Operations.
5. **A restart or reboot is required:** confirm the maintenance window and business-owner approval.

## Validation

- Unit is active and enabled as designed
- Application health endpoint passes
- No restart loop appears in the journal


## Rollback

- Restore the recorded previous setting, permission, service account, policy assignment, binding, package, or configuration file.
- Restart only the affected component when necessary.
- Re-run the validation checks and document whether rollback restored service.
- Use the approved backup or recovery procedure if the change caused data or service corruption.

## Escalation criteria

Escalate to the platform owner when any of the following applies:

- The issue affects more than five users, a domain controller, a production server, or a critical business service.
- The same failure returns after one verified correction.
- Data loss, suspected compromise, certificate/private-key exposure, or privileged-access abuse is possible.
- Required access, vendor support, outage approval, or maintenance-window authority is unavailable.
- Recovery threatens the documented RPO or RTO.

## Security and compliance notes

- Use least privilege and never share administrative credentials.
- Redact tokens, passwords, private keys, message contents, and personal data from screenshots and tickets.
- Preserve relevant logs before clearing caches, restarting services, or removing records.
- Document all access and configuration changes with the ticket or change number.

## Ticket documentation example

```text
INC-260818 — Troubleshoot systemd Service Failures

Impact: One business service or user workflow was degraded.
Evidence: Symptoms reproduced and command output attached.
Cause: Invalid unit configuration.
Resolution: Corrected the verified configuration or service condition and repeated the validation checks.
Validation: Unit is active and enabled as designed; Application health endpoint passes.
Closure: User or service owner confirmed normal operation. No sensitive data was placed in the ticket.
```

## Evidence checklist

- [ ] Initial symptom and exact error captured
- [ ] Relevant command output or log events attached
- [ ] Root cause supported by evidence
- [ ] Corrective action and previous value documented
- [ ] Validation completed from the user or service perspective
- [ ] Monitoring confirmed healthy
- [ ] User or service owner notified
